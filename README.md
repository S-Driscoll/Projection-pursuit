### Kurtosis-Based Projection Pursuit
`projpursuit.m` is a MATLAB function to perform kurtosis-based projection pursuit.

`projpursuit.py` is a Python function that is more or less a line by line port of the MATLAB function. `kurtosis.py` is a python implementation of the MATLAB function `kurtosis.m`. A list of dependencies to run `projpursuit.py` are found in `dependencies.txt`.
